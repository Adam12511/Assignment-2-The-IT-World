									<h3>Introduction to Cloud Computing</h3>
									<p>As times are going forward, so is the evolution of technology. No longer are the times of hard drives the size of fridges and computers the size of buildings. In modern times both computers and hard drives are relatively small and cheap. While the digital size of storage devices increases with time, so does the amount of information and files. The cloud system plays an essential role in solving this ongoing problem. Cloud storage and servers offers an enticing solution where, through a network such as the internet, information and data are stored on systems that can be accessed remotely meaning for the user, no physical drives will be needed as everything will be stored offsite. The National Institute of Standards and Technology defines cloud computing as a “model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” In the present age all that is needed to access cloud services is only a network connection as the technology has progressed so that the resources used on the users side are kept to a minimum while creating a high speed, efficient and secure environment for the user to interact with. </p>

									<h3>Cloud State-of-the-Art Technology and What Can Be Done Now</h3>
									<p>Cloud computing incorporates many aspects of Information Technology besides storage. State of the art technology relating to cloud computing includes the newly introduced Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative where users can “skip the install, save storage, and jump in” to playing their favourite game from whatever device using just a controller and a subscription to their game pass service. Another aspect of cloud computing includes remote desktop which is defined as a “program or an operating system feature that allows a user to connect to a computer in another location, see that computer's desktop and interact with it as if it were a local system.” This works by capturing the screen of that system and projecting it to your local computer as well as allowing for input from your local system onto the remote system. Since its introduction, it has become a staple for businesses, IT support and organisations such as RMIT University. Cloud computing is currently being led by major IT companies such as Amazon with its Amazon Web Services platform, Google with its Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft with its Azure Platform and Oracle with its Cloud Platform. </p>

									<h3>What is likely to be Done Soon and what Technological or Other Developments make this Possible</h3>
									<p>While the cloud technology has evolved a lot within recent years, it is still evolving at a rapid rate. The most recent adaptation of cloud computing is the enactment of the so called metaverse, headed by many tech firms, the most famous being the recent name changed company of Meta, then known as Facebook. Their main goal is to introduce an evolution of connection with their slogan being “Connection is evolving and so are we”. They aim to use social media and the cloud platform to introduce a VR/AR style of connecting to various things such as other peoples, being able to work a job in a computer simulated environment and much more. Cloud computing is also now being used for the distribution of AI services with the CEO of Google proclaiming it as  “more profound than electricity or fire”. The 3 major technologies that make cloud computing possible are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which is offering physical and virtual machines through a network, Platform as a Service (PaaS), which is used to test applications and used to design other applications through a network, and Software as a Service (SaaS), which is a “transmission of Applications to end-users by the web browsers”. </p>

									<h3>What are the Potential Impacts of Cloud Computing?</h3>
									<p>There are many impacts of cloud computing on businesses and society in general. On the business side, cloud computing “ can cause a dramatic decrease in labour and maintenance costs”.	Another key advantage is that “the client has the flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources” being used which also includes the amount of storage available. It also allows for the implementation of a disaster recovery plan which lets the organisation plan for the recover of data in the event of a disaster. On the society side, cloud computing affects our lives in various ways. It allows for social media to exist by using the cloud to store pictures and messages. “Cloud has brought a revolution in the entertainment industry” as well with Netflix being a key example. Other examples of the impacts cloud computing has on society include online shopping, digitized patient records, online education and online communication.</p>

									<h3>What is Likely to Change?</h3>
									<p>In terms of cloud computing, there’s not much that can be changed but there is much that it can be applied to. In the future the aspects of cloud computing that are most likely to change is that it could become more secure to better protect client data, it could become more economic in terms of money and cost and finally, it can be applied to more areas such as AI, Art, Healthcare and more.</p>

									<h3>Which People will be most affected and how?</h3>
									<p>The people most affected by cloud computing are mainly businesses and organisations as in modern times, all if not most businesses and organisations use the cloud to store their information, whether its confidential or not. It is predicted that by 2025 there will be around 200 zettabytes of global data storage, half of which will be stored in the cloud. If cloud technology was to be more applied in other fields and was more secure as well as cheaper, it would cost less for more variations of businesses to store their data securely meaning data loss would be less likely and data penetration rates would be lower. Cloud computing will also affect the general public as well as staff and students as it allows for remote activities such as work and education. It also affects the gaming and entertainment industries as, for the gaming industry, games and account data and progress are stored in the cloud and the cloud allows for game streaming. For the entertainment industry, movies and tv shows are stored in the cloud to be streamed at any time for the user of the streaming service. By making the cloud more secure, piracy will be a much harder feat and by making it cheaper it could possibly make the appropriate streaming services more affordable.</p>

									<h3>Will this Create, Replace, or Make Redundant Current Jobs or Technologies?</h3>
									<p>Cloud computing will replace and make redundant current jobs more then it will create. Use of the cloud allows for the relieving of workload and by adding automation software tools you can cut costs, reduce errors, and improve efficiency. In doing so, a lot of current jobs will not be needed, and organisations can save a lot of money by using cloud automation rather then hiring workers who are prone to human error and paying them a $70k salary. Possibly the only jobs it will create is software development for cloud technologies and maintenance of cloud servers.</p>

									<h3>How will this Affect you, your family and/or your friends?</h3>
									<p>Cloud computing affects the general public in many ways. In the publics daily lives, the cloud is being used more often than people think. People store files, photos, and videos on cloud servers everyday as well as watch shows and movies on streaming services and play games with other people. Again, by making the cloud more secure, piracy will be a much harder feat and by making it cheaper it could possibly make the appropriate streaming services more affordable. As more developments are made with adapting cloud technology to other aspects of the world, we, as a society, will continue to evolve at a rapid rate and our technology will allow for many developments of household technologies, scientific discoveries, and a more efficient and effective way of carrying out common tasks. This whole principle applies not only to individuals but to whole groups of people such as ones own family and friends. All in all, not much will be different from an individuals perspective at the current rate of cloud technological development but maybe someday in the future when a possible major breakthrough occurs it could change not only yours but a everyone’s whole lives.</p>
