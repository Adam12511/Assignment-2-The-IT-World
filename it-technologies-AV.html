										<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<pAn autonomous vehicle allows for machine learning and 3D live imaging to be able to drive 
									     itself from one point to another point without needing a human to interact with it. Autonomous 
									     vehicles are an up-and-coming technology which are currently in development and are becoming 
									     increasingly better over the years as current technology improves and will make autonomous vehicles
									     a widely used technology in the future. A state of the art autonomous vehicle currently has LiDAR 
									     (Light Detection and Ranging), RADAR (Radio detecting and ranging) and a camera to help with 3D imaging,
									     which all help to pinpoint the vehicleâ€™s location and help it navigate through its surroundings. Autonomous
									     vehicles also have state of the art machine learning involved which has been refined over many years so that 
									     it can be used in autonomous vehicles and be able to learn pathways to help in directing autonomous vehicles 
									     and to be able to conduct the autonomous vehicle in a safe manner so that no accident is caused. It is also a 
									     state of the art car with all the features that any current car being developed might have, such as reduced energy
									     consumption. Further developments in LiDAR, RADAR and camera tracking technology will allow for more precision in
									     autonomous vehicles and can help stop accidents from happening as well as help solve the issues they are currently
									     facing with weather conditions such as fog and rain which interrupts the 3D imaging and makes it harder on autonomous 
									     vehicles to navigate under these weather conditions. There will also be improvements in the software used in these autonomous
									     vehicles so that no issues will be found with them that may cause accidents or for an error to occur that is not meant to happen
									     in the autonomous vehicle such as inputting a destination and being taken to the wrong destination. These are current issues 
									     which autonomous vehicle manufacturers are trying to solve right now for the future improvement of autonomous vehicles with
									     some of the problems on track to being fixed within the next decade. Within the next couple of years some companies manufacturing
									     autonomous vehicles are planning to release them to the commercial market for use on roads for all and will be available for 
									     everyone to buy. A survey was conducted by McKinsey&Company in which 75 executives from companies such as automotive, transportation,
									     and software that are working on autonomous vehicles and autonomous driving worldwide were asked about when autonomous 
									     vehicles would start to be rolled out with the results being in figure 1. </p>

									
									<p>The results show that most are expecting the first generation of autonomous vehicles to be released commercially around 2024 
										and later more complex autonomous vehicles such as trucks to come within the following decade. Countries are currently 
										assessing autonomous vehicles with some countries allowing for the use of autonomous vehicles on roads and others in the process
										of being passed for use on roads, which can be seen in figure 1. With time autonomous vehicles will be seen commonly on the roads
										as the technology continues to rapidly improve and the market allows for easier purchasing of autonomous vehicles and more common
										modes of transport becoming autonomous. Further developments in machine learning and 3D imaging technology make autonomous vehicles
										possible to be made as without either of these technologies autonomous vehicles would not be able to be produced. Improvements in that 
										such as better 3D tracking via camera and improved AI and machine learning will allow for better autonomous vehicles with lower risks
										and allow them to be able to be brought to a wider market with some countries that may be against autonomous vehicles also adopting them
										into their country.  </p>
