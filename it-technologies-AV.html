										<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
									</header>

								

									<p> An autonomous vehicle allows for machine learning and 3D live imaging to be able to drive 
									     itself from one point to another point without needing a human to interact with it. Autonomous 
									     vehicles are an up-and-coming technology which are currently in development and are becoming 
									     increasingly better over the years as current technology improves and will make autonomous vehicles
									     a widely used technology in the future. A state of the art autonomous vehicle currently has LiDAR 
									     (Light Detection and Ranging), RADAR (Radio detecting and ranging) and a camera to help with 3D imaging,
									     which all help to pinpoint the vehicle’s location and help it navigate through its surroundings. Autonomous
									     vehicles also have state of the art machine learning involved which has been refined over many years so that 
									     it can be used in autonomous vehicles and be able to learn pathways to help in directing autonomous vehicles 
									     and to be able to conduct the autonomous vehicle in a safe manner so that no accident is caused. It is also a 
									     state of the art car with all the features that any current car being developed might have, such as reduced energy
									     consumption. Further developments in LiDAR, RADAR and camera tracking technology will allow for more precision in
									     autonomous vehicles and can help stop accidents from happening as well as help solve the issues they are currently
									     facing with weather conditions such as fog and rain which interrupts the 3D imaging and makes it harder on autonomous 
									     vehicles to navigate under these weather conditions. There will also be improvements in the software used in these autonomous
									     vehicles so that no issues will be found with them that may cause accidents or for an error to occur that is not meant to happen
									     in the autonomous vehicle such as inputting a destination and being taken to the wrong destination. These are current issues 
									     which autonomous vehicle manufacturers are trying to solve right now for the future improvement of autonomous vehicles with
									     some of the problems on track to being fixed within the next decade. Within the next couple of years some companies manufacturing
									     autonomous vehicles are planning to release them to the commercial market for use on roads for all and will be available for 
									     everyone to buy. A survey was conducted by McKinsey&Company in which 75 executives from companies such as automotive, transportation,
									     and software that are working on autonomous vehicles and autonomous driving worldwide were asked about when autonomous 
									     vehicles would start to be rolled out with the results being in figure 1. </p>
									
									<img src="autonomous_vehicles_figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" class="center">

									
									<p>The results show that most are expecting the first generation of autonomous vehicles to be released commercially around 2024 
										and later more complex autonomous vehicles such as trucks to come within the following decade. Countries are currently 
										assessing autonomous vehicles with some countries allowing for the use of autonomous vehicles on roads and others in the process
										of being passed for use on roads, which can be seen in figure 1. With time autonomous vehicles will be seen commonly on the roads
										as the technology continues to rapidly improve and the market allows for easier purchasing of autonomous vehicles and more common
										modes of transport becoming autonomous. Further developments in machine learning and 3D imaging technology make autonomous vehicles
										possible to be made as without either of these technologies autonomous vehicles would not be able to be produced. Improvements in that 
										such as better 3D tracking via camera and improved AI and machine learning will allow for better autonomous vehicles with lower risks
										and allow them to be able to be brought to a wider market with some countries that may be against autonomous vehicles also adopting them
										into their country.  </p>
									<h3> Impact of Autonomous Vehicles </h3>

									<p>The impact that autonomous vehicles will have will cause a massive change in the vehicles industry as it is a brand-new technology for the market.
										It is likely going to make more people start to buy autonomous vehicles over the standard non-autonomous vehicle due to it being simpler and 
										more convenient for the driver not having to drive, allowing them to not have to interfere with the car in any way. Autonomous vehicles will 
										also affect everyone in the future as autonomous vehicles become more common and will change the way people travel from one destination to another
										destination as they become commonplace on forms of public transport and personal vehicles. Autonomous vehicles will replace some jobs such as
										ones related to driving like, truck drivers that deliver supplies, taxi drivers or train drivers and more as these will be operated by autonomous
										vehicles which don’t need human input to drive them. Autonomous vehicles will not only replace but also create jobs as well in fields such as 
										software developing, AI and 3D imaging which are needed for the continual production and improvement of autonomous vehicles. Companies such as
										Ford, one of the leading car manufacturers behind autonomous vehicles have put out job requests for jobs such as AI investment and other 
										companies such as GM another leading car manufacturer behind autonomous vehicles have also advertised for new jobs under autonomous vehicles. 
										The manufacturing of autonomous vehicles has overall lead to the creation of a whole new job field which has already give thousands of jobs to 
										people and will only increase as autonomous vehicles continue to be demanded and once released on the market will only increase even higher in
										demand which will lead to more jobs in the field in the future. </p>
									
									<h3> Effect of Autonomous Vehicles </h3>
									
									<p> Autonomous vehicles will change my daily life by changing the ways that I travel as autonomous vehicles will become more and more common in public transport. 
										It may make me start using them more in my daily life due to the convenience that they provide over a non-autonomous vehicle. Others will also be affected
										in their daily life by using autonomous vehicles when doing things such as a daily commute to work and may choose to use autonomous public transport which
										is open 24 hours or private autonomous vehicles more often as it becomes more convenient and less intensive due to not having to drive and can just wait
										in the vehicles while they go from one destination to another. Through the use of autonomous vehicles, the time it takes travelling between places will
										also go through a change as more people adopt the using of autonomous vehicles over non-autonomous vehicles to help create a safer road through using
										autonomous vehicles over non-autonomous vehicles as they will be safer due to the human error that can happen in a non-autonomous vehicle. Autonomous 
										vehicles will allow for more places to be more easily connected as they will be able to travel great distances without the need to stop and can make long 
										distance travel much easier for everyone and can allow things such as food, parcels and more to be sent more quickly than before. Autonomous vehicles will
										help in preventing supply issues which may be caused in the past other than natural disasters and allow for cheaper prices on goods. Long-distance travel
										will also be easier allowing for more people to be able to spread out and to be able to visit other far away locations more easily, helping solve issues 
										with isolated communities, with issues such as a lack of medical resources. </p>
