                  <h3>Machine Learning in summary</h3>
									<p>Machine learning (ML), a field with an unimaginably expansive definition when it was first coined in 1952 has, over the past 70 years, experienced such growth to encompass nearly every facet of modern life. It is currently seen as a subset of Artificial Intelligence and is generally defined as a computer system capable of learning without explicit instruction by imitating human intelligence.  The model was first developed by Donald Hebb in his 1949 release, The Organisation of Behaviour, in which he outlined a theoretical system of neural networks in which two neurons or nodes activated consecutively, where the activation of Neuron A is a direct precursor to Neuron B, would result in strengthened connections between the two cells. This behaviour inspired the phrase “cells that fire together, wire together” and became the basis of learning algorithms(Brown 2021).
<br>MIT Sloan’s Thomas Malone outlined 3 types of Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Supervised machine learning</li> In which data is manually labelled by a human before being fed to the algorithm, training the program to specifically identify the item it is presented with.
<li>Unsupervised learning</li> Involves unlabelled data being fed to a program and allowing it to identify their own patterns without being prompted.
<li>Reinforcement learning</li>Draws parallels with psychology’s operant conditioning. Data is fed to a program and the program is allowed to make choices to lead towards an unknown correct outcome. Correct choices are rewarded, increasing the “weight” of these pathways, while incorrect choices are discouraged and over time the program creates its own parameters to refine its precision.
</ul>
In 1952, a version of Hebbian Learning had been applied by Arthur Samuel in his checkers game simulation which, over several rounds, would memorise the positions and gameplay it had encountered and would reward gameplay that had resulted in a win. This system partnered with a rudimentary minmax algorithm became the world’s first practical application of machine learning
<br>Within the next few decades Samuel’s design and Hebb’s model were combined to create custom navigation systems, autonomous vehicles, and AIs capable of learning through mimicry.

									<h3>Machine learning in the modern day</h3>
									<p>In the present-day machine learning algorithms are central to innumerable tasks and applications. Navigation and commute apps such as Google Maps and Uber use it to calculate traffic congestion and travel duration and banks rely on ML for fraud prevention (Tyagi 2021)
<br>Cutting edge algorithms like <em>HRNet</em> and <em>FixEfficientNet</em> improve on the ground-breaking work of 2012’s <em>AlexNet</em> and pave the way in computer vision by using a variety of techniques such as <strong>Semantic Segmentation</strong> (in which each pixel of an image is categorised as a relevant object allowing identification of multiple unique structures within a single image),<strong> Facial Landmark Detection </strong>(where specific facial structures can be located and isolated), and <strong>Human Pose Estimation</strong> (in which human body motion can be identified and mapped). These newer trained algorithms maintain image resolution as they are processed through by using a convolutional neural network, allowing for more accurate segmentation and detection(Marius 2020) (Pamplona Segundo et al. 2010).
<br> Meanwhile models like BERT are used in Natural Language Processing. Where previous models adopted unidirectional processing, in which a sentence would be read either forwards or backwards, BERT reads sentences bidirectionally, training it to understand the context of specific words within a sentence and can be used to identify and emulate the emotions with which sentences are written, a.k.a. Sentiment Analysis. This is via the use of a transformer program, capable of recognising relationships between input components. E.g., identification of a spherical ball, a person, grass and a stadium would allow the program to identify that the game of soccer is likely being depicted in an image (Horev 2018).
<br>Models like T5-11B can answer questions, Bayesian Time SVD++ is able to identify shopping patterns and recommend relevant products to customers and speech recognitions systems like ContextNet are used every day in virtual assistants like Siri and and Alexa (Marius 2020).
<br>In more recently pressing events, ML algorithms are currently being used in contact tracing for Covid-19 and predicting viral spread. Computer vision ML can screen for Covid-19 symptoms and differentiate Covid induced pneumonia from other strains (Kamalov et al. 2021). ML has also become vital in drug development processes for identifying target DNA sequences and predicting drug-target interactions (Guefrechi et al. 2021).
<br>This boom in development over the last decade is primarily due to the development of LSTM, CNN and Transformer models, becoming increasingly capable of maintaining input integrity and the ability for newer AI to be trained off previous algorithms. The exponential growth of datasets and the rapidly increasing quality of hardware should see AI become inescapable in the near future. Developments such as fully autonomous vehicles, undetectable deepfakes, wholly immersive online environments, uniquely personalised medication and treatments based on your own DNA, and maybe even the singularity are just over the horizon.

                  <h3> The Future of Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>Why wait for monkeys on a typewriter to write Hamlet when University of Oxford scientists predict self-governed AI will be capable of writing bestselling books by 2049…and performing surgeries four years after that (Marr 2021). AI has proven itself capable of being immensely useful the modern human. While we should be excited for the upcoming advancements machine learning will have in fields such as science, gaming, architecture and providing greater accessibility towards those with disabilities, the societal repercussions of AI mass adoption should also be kept in view. ML growth has been accompanied by issues with accessing private data, constant surveillance, and the drastic environmental kickback caused by increased energy requirements, just to name a few. AI currently thrives from very little government oversight worldwide and is predicted to exceed $110billion global annual spending within the next year. In an article for the Harvard Business Review, Reid Blackman argues, issues with human unemployment and wealth inequality caused by AI are only theorised upon by lawyers and ethicists, while the data scientists creating the algorithms remain isolated, overlooking the input of experts (Blackman 2021). He also mentions that most existing ethical considerations are introduced late in the development lifecycle and significant effort must be made to have ethics be at the forefront of development from the beginning. Concerns about hyperwars, in which AI process national security data and enact consequences on perceived threats without human involvement, is becoming a valid concern. In the near future, issues regarding AI accountability and the ethical treatment of machines will have to become part of everyday conversation. Sundar Pichai in his interview with Marques Brownlee stresses the importance of accountability within private organisations while government frameworks are slowly being established and explains that while government oversight has the potential to hinder AI development where those outside the field are given power to dictate rule within the field, he believes that open collaboration between the private and public sector will assist in mitigating risk or at least allowing the general public to be aware of the risks involved with increased adoption of AI (MKBHD 2021).
Despite these seemingly apocalyptic sentiments, it must also be addressed that organisations such as Google and IBM, frontrunners in ML, seem have robust guidelines to address these concerns and setting the example for a future in which AI and humans are capable of coexisting.
For the author, modern AI technologies highlight a time of endless possibility particularly within medicine where neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, everything from cancer to the common cold could be totally mitigated, if not eradicated. Humans may be able to frequently surpass the biblical limit of 120y/o and we may eventually be able to transfer our consciousness between custom-tailored bodies. His parents’ jobs in accounting and family medicine slowly become more AI populated. Where 85% of medical accidents are caused by human error, the introduction of ML in specialties such as surgery and anaesthesia could have a significant impact on patient wellbeing. ML usage in the transport sector will see the rise of self-driving/ autonomous vehicles, allowing freight delivery to operate unencumbered by concerns like driver health and safety.However, in the majority of occupations an MIT Task Force Paper suggests rather than workers becoming obsolete, AI is likely to fuel incredible growth and innovation, creating new fields of work and more jobs. A wide range of disabilities are also being addressed: smartphone apps capable of reading documents and navigating via the camera for those with vision impairments, real time captioning for hearing impairments etc. eventually AI may allow the development of fully functioning artificial eyes and ears, giving full autonomy and independence to everyone.
