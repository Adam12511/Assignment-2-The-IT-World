										<h2>IT Work Interview</h2>
										<p>With Thomas O'Neill</p>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/interview.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Interview impressions and conclusions</h3>
									<p>Thomas O’Neill is a Threat Intelligence Analyst working at ANZ bank and agreed to our request
										for an interview into his line of work. According to his LinkedIn page, he graduated from RMIT
										University in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology (hopefully, like most of
										us will) and worked as a sales assistant at Dick Smith before joining ANZ bank. Aaron Chan of
										this team was a colleague of his for a year before Thomas had been promoted to a position in
										one of ANZ’s cybersecurity teams as an analyst. </p>


									<p>Aby Thomas (Primary interviewer) and Adam Lee (Secondary interviewer) interviewed Thomas O’Neill
										on the 25th of April 2022. From impressions going into the interview from Aby and Adam they
										expected some level of confidentiality and secrecy from a “cybersecurity” IT professional, that
										Thomas would tailor his answers to be as non-identifiable as possible. Also, from freely available
										media, Aby had the idea that PC operating systems, such as a Microsoft Windows and Linux, would
										be the base kit in Thomas’s cybersecurity tools and wanted to learn about more sophisticated
										hardware or programs, though from the earlier impression of secrecy in cybersecurity, he wasn’t
										sure if Thomas could reveal those. </p>

									<p>During the interview, Thomas explained that his role in cybersecurity was more preventative rather
										than reactive as depicted in mass media, that most of his work was in the line of detecting and
										predicting potential breaches in ANZ’s systems before that had a chance to occur. He mentioned that
										he had no fixed schedule or program to go about his work as the nature of potential changes
										regularly and he must employ different tools and skills to analyze and detect these threats. This
										was surprising, as Aby and Adam imagined a more structured work lifestyle for an IT professional.
										Aby and Adam also discussed the training Thomas received for his occupation and found it interesting
										that the vast majority qualifications and experience were acquired on the job, although he did
										undertake a course provided by compTIA and SANS, online IT accreditation services as well as a module
										in Ethical Hacking. While Thomas did mention he would not be able to divulge some of his activities,
										it was interesting to learn of some of his stories that he learned in the cybersecurity division
										pertaining to widespread attacks that seem intrusive but not malicious towards the general public.
									</p>
									<p>After the interview Aby and Adam were more confident in their understanding of Thomas O’Neill’s general
										day-to-day and felt comfortable with the prospect of ICT security jobs, if they ever wanted to apply
										for one. As Thomas stated, “just having a genuine interest in the [cyber-attacks] that are going on”
										can be boon when apply or working in a cybersecurity field. Qualifications and skills can be acquired
										through public resources, allowing for accessibility into the profession or just be a useful skill to
										have in an IT career. Thomas’s account of his job was a great window into what one can expect from
										applying an IT background for a cybersecurity career. </p>
