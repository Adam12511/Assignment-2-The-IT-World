									<h3>Sahil</h3>

									<p> My name is Sahil, my Student Number is s3943681 and our team name is “We Want Tesla's”.
									I am a New Zealand born; Melbourne raised Fijian Indian. I speak English and Fijian Hindustani. 
									I am currently in my first year of university at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a 
									Bachelor of Information Technology. I am left-handed when it comes to writing but with other aspects of 
									life such as sports, I prefer my right hand and am considered ambidextrous. Some hobbies I have are playing 
									soccer, playing video games, watching many tv shows and movies, and cooking. Regarding my interest in Information 
									Technology, it sparked from an early age. I grew up when technology was rapidly advancing and the world around me 
									massively changed due to technology. Video games were my gateway into IT (Information Technology) and since then 
									I became more interested in technology in general. Since my generation grew up with technology, I grew
									accompanied with it and I become the ‘IT Technician’ of my family. IT is a fast-growing industry with a lot of 
									jobs, especially in Australia, and it pays well, and since I know my way around technology, I figured I might 
									as well make a career out of it. </p>
									
									<p> When forming a team, it should be taken into consideration that I am 100% introverted and while I am able 
										to socially adapt, I might feel uncomfortable, or I may not know how to approach others with ideas. 
										Some extra effort may be required for me to be able to be open to my team members. Furthermore, as I am 
										less creative than the average human being, my ideas are more inclined to be from within the box then 
										outside the box, which can affect the variety of answers from the group, but I think these results will 
										influence my behaviour in a team very insignificantly. While these results may say otherwise, I am 
										particularly good at working in a team and with others. While I am 100% introverted, I can socially 
										adapt to any group and while I may not be as creative, I make up for it in resourcefulness. These 
										results may influence my perception on how others may see or interact with me. Besides that, these 
										results should not impact my behaviour while working in a team.

									<h3>Aaron</h3>
									<p>Aaron currently works as a Data Analysis Operator and is studying part-time at RMIT for a Bachelor 
										of IT under student ID number s3931673. His Introduction to Information Technology course assigned 
										him to the team “We Want Teslas”. His various interests include video games, reading science and 
										fantasy fiction, and more recently table-top games (RPGs or board games). Aaron has always been 
										technology inclined, whether it would be for gaming, peculiar gadgets or scientific advancements, 
										he would try to get his hands on a device to explore its capabilities. During his time in high school 
										when delving into his school’s email software he picked up a programming interest and started using 
										Python to send automated emails. </p>

									<p>Aaron’s 16Personalities test determined that he has a diplomatic, turbulent mediator personality. 
										He prefers to cooperate than compete with his peers and does not define personal success with 
										concrete measurements such as a high salary or awards. As a visual learner, according to the 
										Educator Planner Learning style test, he optimally studies with visual aids explaining concepts 
										rather than just reading about the concept with text only. Videos, diagrams and live demonstrations 
										are ideal learning tools. Truity’s Big Five Personality test indicates that in most scenarios he is 
										open with his thoughts when asked but will often keep them to himself if not prompted to. He is more 
										inclined to cooperation than challenging peers and be easily stressed by negative emotions.</p>
