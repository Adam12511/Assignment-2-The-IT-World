										<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

									</header> Introduction to Cybersecurity



									<p>Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from cyberattacks. The purpose of cybersecurity is to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of technologies, networks, programs, devices, and data.
There are multiple types of network attacks that can occur, which is inclusive of attacks against confidentiality, integrity, and availability.	Network attacks against confidentiality is when unauthorised users access our data, applications, or environments. Network attacks against integrity is when certain data and information is accessed without authorisation and is altered or compromised. Network attacks against availability is when unauthorised users attack servers, which causes servers to crash and legitimate users are denied the service.
</p>

									<h3>Blockchain Cybersecurity</h3>
									<p>Cybersecurity is an interesting and important industry as it helps protect people and organisations from potential cyber threats. With the advancement of technology, there have been countless possibilities regarding cybersecurity. Blockchain cybersecurity is one of the newest cybersecurity technologies out there. The blockchain technology refers to a system that records information in such a way that it’s difficult for someone to hack into the system and steal sensitive data. Blockchain began as a technology behind bitcoin but has now become a promising mitigation technology for cybersecurity. Blockchain has evolved over time and is now one of the most secure forms of transacting in the digital network. Security of private messaging is one of the ways blockchain can enhance cybersecurity. Social media platforms are on the rise and there are several social platforms that people use worldwide that are safeguarded by frail and unreliable passwords. Blockchain can be used to secure private messaging by forming a unified API framework, through the development of a standard security protocol. Many cyberattacks have been launched on social platforms in the past, such as Twitter and Facebook, and millions of accounts have been compromised and hacked due to poorly protected and vulnerable accounts. If blockchain technologies is implemented well into such messaging systems, it may prevent such cyberattacks in the future. </p>
									<h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning within Cybersecurity</h3>

									<p>With the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning, this opens exciting new possibilities for cybersecurity. Artificial intelligence and machine learning improves the cybersecurity process of finding cyber threats and possible malicious activities and locate threats before they even can occur.  These technologies are vital for companies as it improves their security defence by increasing their speed and accuracy of their cybersecurity response. Cyberattacks have increased, since the transition of businesses making the digital transformation. [1] Ransomware attacks are happening every 11 seconds, causing businesses to experience temporary closedown. Implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning will help prevents such attacks, as these technologies can assist in detecting anomalies, predicting future data breaches and to be able to respond to data breaches in real-time.</p>
									<h3>The Future of Cybersecurity</h3>
									<p>Automation of cybersecurity is the possibility for the future of this technology. Cybersecurity automation provides staff members with the opportunity to not have to manually go through each threat alert. It is quite common for hackers to create diversions and distractions, attempting to confuse security analysts with false events. Increased automation is one step in the right direction, as it provides us with many benefits. Automation increases efficiency as it speeds up the collection of data, allowing for a faster incident response. Automation decreases the number of staff hours working on security tasks. Automation leads to fewer mistakes with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Automation can also provide more protection for businesses as it can easily find deficiencies within the business environment.
As cyberattacks have grown rapidly over the years, automation is becoming increasingly important in detecting threats and minimising their impact.
</p>
<h3>What are the Potential Impacts of Cybersecurity?</h3>
<p>Implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning into cybersecurity has a positive impact as it improves the efficiencies of our workplaces and provides people with the opportunity to spend their time and resources on tasks that involve more creativity and empathy, among others. Artificial intelligence within cybersecurity minimises the human effort, and as a result decreases human error and mistakes. This technology is a system with high level of redundancy; however, it does not impact workers in a negative way as they can focus on other tasks that would be more effective for their workforce. This technology just simply relieves them of the hassle of constantly dealing with cyber threats. Without the need for human involvement, staff members can focus their time on more valuable work, such as improving threat intelligence. Cybersecurity is a field that has been rapidly growing in the IT industry, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Information Security Analyst’s Outlook, jobs related to cybersecurity are in extremely high demand as it is among the fastest-growing careers in the United States. [2] “The BLS predicts cybersecurity jobs will grow 31% through 2029, over seven times faster than the national average job growth of 4%.” The high demand for cybersecurity jobs increases the opportunities for people with cybersecurity backgrounds, skills, and qualifications to achieve high employment rates. Furthermore, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the BLS predicts that there will be a 28% increase in the demand for information analysts between the years 2016 and 2026. That would be an approximate increase of 28,500 jobs relating to cybersecurity. This data is a bit old, however it represents the future of cybersecurity as it may increase cybersecurity-related work. Cybersecurity is an important aspect for everyone in society as it prevents the theft of sensitive data and information and prevents cyber attackers from causing harm or destruction.</p>
<h3>How will this Affect you, your family and/or your friends? </h3>
<p>The impact of cyber-attacks on end users can have a devastating impact on their lives. Cyber-attacks can cause electoral blackouts, failure of military equipment, including breaches of national security secrets. Cyber-attacks can also result in personal information being leaked and sensitive data such as medical records being stolen. Not only do countries and businesses face threats from the actions and intentions of hackers, but individuals also face many risks. Many individuals are unaware of the risk of cyber-attacks and don’t realise how vulnerable they are. Many individuals believe that their technologies and devices are completely safe and protected from hackers, as most individuals have the mindset of believing that hackers aren’t interested in them. However, this is simply incorrect, as the public with low status is at a higher risk of being hacked than big name companies, as such companies are capable of being able to afford resources and staff members with years of experience and security-based skills. In our daily lives, we all use devices, this could include mobile phones, computers, TVs, smartwatches, speakers, garage door openers, cars and many more. The one thing each device listed has in common is that all these devices can be hacked. A lot of these things are used in a daily basis, and it can be compromised due to cyber-attacks. Cyberattacks are now so common, that recent reports in the US show that hackers attack every 39 seconds. Therefore, cybersecurity has been implemented in our lives, to help protect us from such threats. It is vital for end users like me and my family to protect themselves from malicious cyber-attacks online.</p>
