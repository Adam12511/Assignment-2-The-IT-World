									<h3>Xiaolong Guo</h3>


								        <p>This is the longest assignment I’ve ever worked on in a group, and we are going to work even longer in the coming assignment. I’m happy to have such great groupmates that everyone has provided a great contribution. In the beginning of the assignment, I was so introverted that just listen to the discussion among my groupmates rather than speaking and expressing my opinion during the tutorial class and the meeting. But as time went by, I found that all my groupmates are kind and helpful, my opinions are treated with sincere respect, so I also started to talk and participate in the discussion. I have to say, during this one-month long assignment, I’ve become more courageous, and I learned how to cooperate, which is way more effective and interesting than working alone. I would like to specifically thank Aaron, who is an excellent leader in our group. Aaron is the guy who sorted all the tasks out and distributed them to us. Aaron is also then one who held the meeting to make the whole group follow up the progress. Aaron, without doubt, did the most contribution to our group. I also want to say thank you to Aby, who helped a lot with my project idea. He did a lot of research and provided some useful articles that we can improve our project. Aby can analyse the problem from different angle, which expand the function that our project may achieve. Other group members have also finished their work efficiently, which make the whole assignment much easier than I thought. I can’t wait for our collaboration on the next assignment. </p>

									<h3>Mihir Anand</h3>
									<p>This was my first time working in a group project after a very long time and I’m glad I found great teammates for this assignment. I’m very happy with their contribution as everyone attempted their best and completed their allocated tasks very efficiently. In the beginning of the assignment, I was a bit overwhelmed and slightly nervous because I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing, but with the assistance of others in my team I was able to complete my work on time. One of the positives was also that everyone was respectful to each other and that we didn’t experience any conflict within the group. In the past, I always liked working individually, but after working with this group I realised that tasks are a lot easier when working with others, especially when we are all on the same page. Although there were many positives that came out of this assignment, all of us could improve on completing tasks before certain due dates and to have better time management skills. Other than that, I’m very happy with this group and with what we have achieved as a team. I’m looking forward to Assignment 3. </p>



								        <h3>Sahil Narayan</h3>
									<p>The group as a whole worked well as a team, the teamwork was great and each member of the group did their allocated tasks to a great standard, down to every detail. The amount of work completed by each member was also vast and great. The group could have allocated tasks better by allocating multiple people to each task rather then having each member do individual tasks. The time management also could have been improved as nearly all tasks were left to the last 2 weeks of the assignment and soft deadlines had to be pushed back in accordance with the time management. One thing that was surprising in this assignment was how well the group worked together to come together to get all the work done and how well we cooperated and function together as a whole. One thing that I learnt from working with my group is how different everyone can be in terms of personality and how well different personality types work together. I also learnt that there are many types of personalities and each of them are unique. </p>

									<h3>Adam Lee</h3>
									<p>This is one of my first assignments done at university and has been the longest so far. Overall, our team worked well, and I am happy that I managed to find teammates that worked as hard as this group has. The group worked well together, and nobody clashed with each other over the duration of the assignment. At first, I was a little nervous and didn’t talk as much but through communicating more with the group I learned to talk more during the meetings and tutorials. From the first meeting everything was planned out and everyone was assigned a role which they all completed to a high standard.  Something that could have been improved upon was working more as a group as opposed to working individually as that would help the group and me personally in understanding the full scope of the assignment and all the small little details. Another thing that could have been improved is better time management towards the end of assignment 2. Both improvements will be considered going forward into assignment 3 and I look forward to working with this group in the future on assignment 3.  </p>

									<h3>Aaron Chan</h3>

									<p>I find all of my team members to be amicable, everyone accepted a general sense of responsibility for their respective tasks without any incidents of conflict, argument or attempts to shy away from their responsibilities. The agreeable nature of the group allowed a fast and seamless transition into the work. That said, this may also be a deterrent to making any innovative actions for ideas that could improve our assignment
										
										It unexpected to see how readily we were able to work together and pool resources once we are in the same room. Thursday practical was the most anyone other myself talked about the project. The compilation process for online groups thanks to MS Teams was more chaotic than I planned, since I fell behind on a task it held up more than I counted on and left the group at a bit of unease. GitHub merge problems were rampant with several members of the group, but most of the work was able to committed after some troubleshooting in the last few meetings.

Going forward, I should assert a more aggressive timetable for tasks, especially for myself, in order to spread out work intensity for the whole group, as an assignment group can be held back by even just a few late entries. </p>
									
									<h3>Aby Thomas </h3>
									
									<p> I find group assignments to be intrinsically motivating as the success of other classmates depends on your contribution and participation. However it’s unusually uncommon to find a group of 5 other students with the same mindset especially during a first year topic. I’m especially appreciative of how reliable everyone else was as it gave me the confidence and freedom to step out of my comfort zone a bit and volunteer to conduct the interview. If I were to repeat this assignment again I think a concerted effort should be made to understand the weighting and difficulty of each individual component. We realised rather late that Xiaolong has shouldered an unexpectedly large portion of the workload.  I would also maybe recommend sharing administrative duties between two people so as not to burden Aaron with too much responsibility ahead of every meeting. In its totality I think the group meshed very well. Everyone was acutely aware of their own duties from the beginning and completed their tasks without hassle while also becoming more collaborative when we realised the workload would have to be shared more evenly. </p>



									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
								        <p>Our team worked coherently together in assigned tasks designated and distributed via a Teams log and was generally successful in completing, albeit in a staggered manner. Our meetings may have been the structure to move the assignment forward, aside from the weekly practical class. This was a surprising transition, as for most of the team this would be different from a group project in secondary school which would entail a near everyday class dedicated to the assignment. The freedom to which a university course offer team assignments made it easier for our team members to work on their task without conflict but may have made it difficult to coordinate our work in a timely matter.</p>

<p>Mihir’s adherence to his organisational skills stood out as he was on the one who handed in in his assignment tasks on time before anyone else, which is in accordance with his Myers-Briggs Personality result of a Sentinel.</p>

<p>Aby volunteered for the interview process and with Adam conducted a well-done interview of Thomas O’Neill, proving a good sense for communication with industry professionals. Aby also helped Xiaolong a lot in our project idea. Aby did a lot of research and provided some useful articles that we can improve our project. Aby can analyse the problem from different angle, which expand the function that our project may achieve.</p>

<p>Early on, the team recognised Aaron’s leadership qualities during meetings and ability to assign tasks based on team input. Task delegation was a smooth process, and everyone understood what their tasks were as a result. This helped the assignment group move forward and prevented people from conflicting during meetings. However, this may have also stifled some opportunities for anyone else on the team if they wanted to be more be outspoken and the team got too comfortable with a singular person in a leadership role. In one meeting where Aaron could not attend the meeting was significantly shorter than the meeting where he was present and chairing.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we will need to treat time management more seriously with incentives to complete tasks on time, such as group meetings dedicated to a singular task instead of merely asking for updates on everyone’s progress. We would have benefited from assigning tasks to multiple people from the start instead of working individually and try to contribute or edit collectively at the end. Adherence to meeting agendas would instead of trying to tackle the first problems that come up naturally in the meeting may provide structure to timely completion.</p>

<p>Most of our GitHub activity was present at the end of our assignment period, due to using file repositories in teams more often than GitHub. Our relative inexperience and lack of confidence in using GitHub was very apparent throughout our assignment. Moving forward, our team will need to utilise GitHub as our main file repository instead of Teams.</p>
